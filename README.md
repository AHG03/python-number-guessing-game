## ðŸ’» Code Overview

The script relies on a single file, number_guessing_game.py, and uses the following key Python concepts:

* **import random**: Used to generate the secret number.
* **random.randint(1, 100)**: Sets the range for the secret number.
* **while True:**: Creates an infinite loop that runs until the correct guess is made.
* **try...except ValueError**: Robust error handling to prevent crashes from non-numeric user input.
